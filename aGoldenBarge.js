// this line tells the bot to include tracery, which is the whole reason we're making this thing. tracery is a javascript tool that allows us to make
// bitchin' random table generators using plain english concepts. you need to understand tracery more than javascript, so please go to the following
// website for a good introduction to this wonderful thing: http://air.decontextualize.com/tracery/

const tracery = require('tracery-grammar');

// this is a tracery function, it has nothing to do with node or discord or anything in this bot except your tracery script. it turns the modifiers on
// for your lists; so if you're using .a or .capitalize or similar modifiers to your tracery grammars, you need this. A Golden Barge does not use modifiers
// as of right now, so we are going to comment this line out. that means we put '// ' in front of the line so that the bot will ignore it.

// grammar.addModifiers(tracery.baseEngModifiers);

// we want to be able to make cool RPG generators without fucking up this bot right? this is important to us, because we're not programmers!
// you read the tutorial linked beforehand, so you should know that when i say "grammar" it means the sentence your bot will speak, and
// when i say "symbols" i means all the words tracery uses to make your sentence random. these lines tell the bot to include your symbols from
// external files, so you can change them and add to them without ever having to change this file. it also tells the bot where to find those files.
// each line is a different list of symbols, in their own files, found in a folder called symbolLists.

const { adjective } = require('./symbolLists/adjectiveList.json');
const { expertise } = require('./symbolLists/expertiseList.json');

// now we need to tell the bot what to look for in those external files when it goes looking to make our grammar.
// the first line of this part tells the bot to create the tracery grammar. the lines after that tell the bot what to look for in those external files.
// for example, on LINE 45 it says 'adjective': adjective, which is the bot telling itself that the #adjective# symbols for our grammar are the same 'adjective'
// found in adjectiveList.json. since we told the bot on LINE 32 that the "adjective" symbols are in a different file, this section tells the bot what to look at
// in that file.

// that is the meat of this bot; it tells the bot exactly what to say using a bevy of random shit written by Daniel Sell, creator of Troika!
// next we will write out the part that checks if the bot works, and tells it to output our grammar when a user types !where in Discord

// first up, let's check to see if the bot is up and running. this is actually really important, if this isn't in your file then the bot won't work!
// what goes on is our bot checks to see if it's ready, and if it is in fact ready, the bot sends a message to the console. since your bot will only likely
// run on your own server, you can just make it say "Ready." personally, i like making it say cool shit. when the bot is read to go, it signals that it is
// running fine "without hesitation" and tells how many discord users can use the bot (sailors) and how many discord servers the bot is installed on (spheres).
// this function will only happen once, whenever the bot is turned on, so we use bot.once

bot.once('ready', async () => {
	console.log (`The Golden Barge sails without hesitation...\n...The Golden Barge ferries ${bot.users.size} sailors among some ${bot.guilds.size} spheres!`);

	// this line generates a link when the bot starts that a server would use to install A Golden Barge. the link contains the permissions the bot needs
	// to execute the commands we give it. it also "catches" any errors and tells the console what went wrong.
	bot.generateInvite(['MANAGE_MESSAGES', 'READ_MESSAGES', 'READ_MESSAGE_HISTORY', 'VIEW_CHANNEL', 'SEND_MESSAGES']).then(link => {
		console.log('The Barge can be sent to new spheres by following this link:\n' + link);
	}).catch(err => {
		console.log(err.stack);
	});

	// discord users can set statuses and activities that show under their names in the people lists, but bots can only show activities. let's give this one something good.
	// you only have a couple options that preceed the name of your activity, and we're choosing the listen one.

	bot.user.setActivity('to The Dead\'s Prayer', { type: 'LISTENING' });
});

// let's send a message to the console whenever a new discord server installs A Golden Barge. this function tells the console how many people are on the server and
// updates the number of active server installs. this function will happen the entire time the bot is on, so we use bot.on

bot.on('guildCreate', guild => {
	console.log(`${bot.users.size} sailors have boarded the Golden Bargeâ€”now servicing ${bot.guilds.size} spheres.`);

// now let's tell the console when a server uninstalls or yeets the bot

bot.on('guildDelete', guild => {
	console.log(`${bot.users.size} sailors have fallen from the Golden Barge. Service shrinks to ${bot.guilds.size} spheres.`);
});

// finally we come to the part where a user can ask the bot for a random Troika! sphere by typing !where in discord.
// to start this process, we tell our bot that it needs to be reading messages. this is called listening.

bot.on('message', async message => {

	// now that the bot is listening for messages, we need to tell it which ones to ignore. this line tells it to ignore the following:
	// messages that don't start with our command prefix (!), messages from other bots (no loops), and it will ignore DMs (no sliding in)

	if (!message.content.startsWith(prefix) || message.author.bot || message.channel.type === 'dm') return;

	// if the message does include the prefix, is not from a bot, and is not a dm, the bot will check to see if it is the right command and then tell it what to do.
	// the bot needs to search for the command by splitting the message up to individual words, and deciding that the first word in the message, after the prefix, is the command.
	// for example, if the user sends a message that says "!eat my shorts" then the bot considers 'eat' the command. if the user's message is "eat my shorts" the bot does nothing.

	// this cuts the message up into individual words after the prefix
	const args = message.content.slice(prefix.length).split(/ +/);

	// this turns the first word into a command (and makes it lowercase for ease of use)
	const command = args.shift().toLowerCase();

	// this bot only has the one command, so if the user's message has anything other than !where the bot goes for a cigarette break.
	// but we still need to tell the bot what to do if the user does in fact send a message in the discord server that says !where
	// we already said "dear bot, if the message is a dm, from another bot, or doesn't have a ! then do nothing" so we need to say "but! if the message
	// says !where then you need to do something."

	// if the user uses the !where the bot will do something. if the bot has permission to delete messages, the bot will delete the !where command from the chat and then serve
	// the grammar. if the bot doesn't have permission to delete, it will catch an error but still serve the grammar. done.
